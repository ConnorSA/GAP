GAP and SOAP documentation
==========================

.. module:: gap

These are the documentation pages for Gaussian Approximation Potential
(GAP) code. GAP is a plugin for QUIP, which is a set of molecular simulation
tools. QUIP itself can be used as a plugin to LAMMPS or called from ASE.

The purpose of the GAP code is to fit interatomic potentials and then
use them for molecular simulation.
